# Datasets composition

The Unsplash dataset is composed of multiple TSV files :

### 1 - photos.tsv
The photos dataset has one row per photo. It contains the different properties
of the photo, some data collected through AI services and overall stats.

Here's the structure:

|-----------------------------|-------------|
| photo_id                       | ID of the Unsplash photo |
| photo_url                      | URL of the photo's page on unsplash.com |
| photo_image_url                | URL of the photo resource on images.unsplash.com |
| photo_submitted_at             | Timestamp of when the photo was submitted to Unsplash |
| photo_featured                 | Whether the photo was promoted to the editorial feed or not |

### 2 - keywords.tsv
The keywords dataset has one row per photo/keyword combination. It contains data
about how a keyword is tied to a photo and how the combination performs in our search engine.

Here's the structure:

| Field                         | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| photo_id                      | ID of the Unsplash photo |
| keyword                       | Keyword or search term |
| keyword_service_1_confidence  | Confidence for the keyword from our 1st 3rd party AI |
| keyword_service_2_confidence  | Confidence for the keyword from our 2nd 3rd party AI |
| keyword_suggested_by_user     | Whether the keyword was added by a user (a human) or not |
| keyword_category              | Category to which Unsplash associates the keyword |
| keyword_subcategory           | Subcategory to which Unsplash associates the keyword |
| search_conversions            | Total # of search conversions for that photo on this keyword |

### 3 - collections.tsv
The collections dataset has one row per photo/collection combination. Whenever a photo
belongs to a collection created by a user, it will appear as one row. Each row describes
when the photo was added to the collection and gives the title of the collection.

Here's the structure:

| Field                         | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| photo_id                      | ID of the Unsplash photo |
| collection_id                 | ID of the Unsplash collection containing the photo |
| collection_title              | Title of the collection containing the photo |
| photo_collected_at            | Timestamp of when the photo was added to the collection |

### 3 - conversions.tsv
The conversions dataset has one row per search conversion. At the moment, it only holds 'downloads' as conversions. The dataset tells you which photo has been downloaded, after which search, from where and by who (anonymously).

Here's the structure:

| Field                         | Description |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| converted_at                  | Timestamp of the conversion event |
| conversion_type               | Type of conversion ('download' only for now) |
| keyword                       | Keyword that was searched and led to the conversion |
| photo_id                      | Photo ID of the photo that converted |
| anonymous_user_id             | Anonymous device ID |
| conversion_country            | Country code of the device geolocation |


## Fit everything together

You can merge the different datasets through the ID fields, usually the Photo ID (photo_id) field.
This way, you'll be able to cross-reference properties from the photos dataset with data from the keywords
dataset for example.
