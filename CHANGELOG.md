# CHANGELOG.md

## 1.0.1 (2020-08-11)

**Fix:**

  - [#13](https://github.com/unsplash/datasets/issues/13): AI landmarks were always empty.
  - Some landmark names were blank instead of NULL
  - Removed duplicated photo id `zV2-QjJqkI` in the Full Dataset

**Lite dataset link:**

  - Version link: [Version 1.0.1](https://unsplash.com/data/lite/1.0.1)
  - Lite dataset links now follow the pattern `https://unsplash.com/data/lite/{version}` (starting at `1.0.1`)

**Integrity checks (SHA-256):**
  - Lite: `aa199951dd8756563f7ffef4abbc2d20c845bcff62241ae677af523728819d60`
  - Full: `ee47f7542e5ef260e6b904046b4837532f420412a0e2c299dcecab55acd28d1f`
