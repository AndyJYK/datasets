# Loading data from the files in Python

## Unzipping the dataset

First of all, unzip the dataset in your preferred folder

```sh
$ unzip {dataset.zip}
```

## Loading the data into Pandas dataframes

The logic to load the data into Pandas dataframes is shown in the [pandas.ipynb notebook](https://github.com/unsplash/research-datasets/blob/master/python/pandas.ipynb).

You can either download and run the notebook or use the Python code inside as a sample.
